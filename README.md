# AI-Trading-Bot
This repository contains a trading bot for Ethereum-based tokens on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and GMX.io. The contract is written in Solidity and uses the UniswapV2 and SushiSwap Router.

## Setup

1. Access [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and [MetaMask](https://www.metamask.io/download).
2. Right Click the 'Contracts' folder and then create a 'New File'. Rename it whatever you want, or: 'bot.sol'
3. Paste the [bot.sol](https://github.com/jack-walters-dev/ai-trading-bot/blob/main/bot.sol) source code from this repository into the file you just created.
4. Go to the <b>'Compile'</b> tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version <b>0.6.6</b>
5. Go to the <b>'Deploy & Run Transactions'</b> tab on Remix, select the <b>'Injected Provider'</b> environment, then click <b>'Deploy'</b>. Once the MetaMask contract creation transaction confirms, your bot is created
6. Deposit funds (at least 0.2 ETH to prevent negating slippage) to your exact contract/bot address
7. After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the <b>'Start'</b> button. Withdraw anytime by clicking <b>'Withdrawal'</b>. Wait about a day for best profit potential.
